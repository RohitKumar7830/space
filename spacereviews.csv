Introduction
Since the late 1950’s, humans in space (defined herein as Low Earth Orbit
(LEO) and beyond) have, with very few exceptions, been restricted to highly
trained astronauts"
3,"Going forward, there is an increasing expectation that
technologies will enable the public to visit and vacation in space"
4,"With the ever
increasing capabilities of what is now termed digital reality (DR) or immersive
presence, there are two approaches to space vacations: virtual and physical"
5,"Both
will be discussed herein (ref"
6,1)
7,"The potential space tourism experiences include
destinations such as space stations, moons, planets, and asteroids"
8,"Also, virtually
only with currently known or projected technology, planets/moons around other
stars"
9,"Discussed herein are the space tourism issues that technology needs to
address/is addressing to enable space tourism, resultant space tourism
experiences and developing commercial deep space"
10,"Space is dark, cold, a nearly
perfect vacuum, with microgravity, GEV, galactic space radiation, unimaginable
distances, where solid matter is a trace species but which supplies the energy that
enables human existence"
11,"Space is often times referred to as the final frontier,
and the general environmental conditions, as stated, are very different than those
under which humans have evolved on Earth"
12,"Therefore, considerable technology
is required to enable humans in space"
13,"In fact, even physics appears to change at
cosmological scales including dark matter/energy, huge disagreements between
quantum theory and the cosmological constant, and the mystery of what
happened to the anti-matter, etc"
14,"There is also the increasing interest in, and
search for, life on other worlds, which may be silicon- or sulfur-based instead of
carbon"
15,"Overall, there is a lot to learn"
16,"Solar system destinations beyond the
Moon/Mars/nearby asteroids require greatly increased trip time (years to
decade(s)), costs, distances, and health and safety technologies"
17,"The Space Tourism Issues and Options
The basic issues which must be addressed to enable space tourism are
safety/reliability and cost/price"
18,"Of these, the first is the most difficult and"
19,"includes many aspects including dust, gravity, radiation, micro/other meteorites
and reliability"
20,There are very encouraging approaches to reducing costs/price
21,Safety [ref
22,"2] – Currently, rockets malfunction-to-explode on the order of
every 100 launches"
23,"That accident rate is on the order of 100 to 1000 times the
accident rate of scheduled airlines"
24,"Sampling of safety and reliability related issues in aerospace:
- Human error, a major source of safety problems, crashes, even after many
decades of Research and Development (R&D) and technologies to reduce such
- Equipment failures, due to design, installation, operational employment,
maintenance, aging, environmental effects, and tipping points for cascading
system failures
- Electron/photon related failures including cyber/software issues,
Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP)/space weather/radiation, jamming, failure of
equipment essential for navigation, controls, sensing, propulsion, and
communications, etc"
25,"- Inadequate margins, especially with regard to a cascading system of systems
failures where reduced capability does not fail the parent part but adversely
impacts in serious ways the functionalities/piece parts that the overall system
depends on for robust performance"
26,"- Operation in extreme environments/in the presence of discrete extreme
environmental/operational conditions
- Bio becoming more virulent in space (e"
27,g
28,"pathogenesis, corrosives)
- Potential impacts of reusability upon safety and reliability and certification for
such
- Human health issues (e"
29,g
30,"micro g, radiation, psychological, accidents, illness,
etc"
31,")
- Costs/profits/schedule exigencies, “corner cutting”
- Oxidative chemistry, causing equipment failure
- Electrostatics, causing electronic failures, fires and explosions
- Planetary and moon dust, abrasive, corrosive, oxidative
- Fatigue and fracture, a prime design metric for much of aerospace equipage
- Unknown unknowns; it is usually not possible to anticipate all combinational
situations, conditions which will result in a reliability issue; we can become
surprised reliability-wise"
32,"- Inadequate analysis and testing, due usually to either cost or inadequate
knowledge or study
In aerospace in general, some 80% of the accidents are due to human factors"
33,"Therefore, the major first order approach to safety would be to utilize
autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) robotics to both manufacture and operate
rockets/space access"
34,"Then there is a long list of safety related design/operational
precepts that can be applied to greatly improve rocket safety as well as the safety
and reliability of the spacecraft, habitats, on-planet transportation and the
systems that keep humans healthy in what, externally, is a terminally unhealthy
space environment"
35,"The dust on the Moon was found during Apollo to be a problem, and Mars,
with its rarefied CO atmosphere, has huge, long lasting dust storms"
36,"Therefore,
2
equipment must be designed to keep the inhabited areas as dust free as possible"
37,"Also, spacecraft/habitats or habs must be designed to protect against
micrometeorites or larger space debris, ensure structural integrity, and be leak
tight"
38,"Radiation in space, outside of the protection of Earth’s magnetic fields and
dense atmosphere, is orders of magnitude worse than that of nuclear weapons"
39,"The most worrisome is Galactic Cosmic Rays or particle radiation, such as fully
ionized iron at tens of GEV energy levels [ref"
40,3]
41,"Protection from this requires
four meters of material, either regolith (living underground) or for in-space habs
the same thickness of materials with a high hydrogen composition to reduce the
major health concerns with regard to secondary neutron production"
42,"This
radiation is carcinogenic and effects nearly all physiological aspects, including the
cardiovascular and central nervous systems"
43,"An alternative radiation protection
approach is fast transits, i"
44,e
45,"200 day round trips to Mars instead of three years
using the usual chemical rockets"
46,"There are at least two approaches to provide
such fast transits"
47,"For destinations beyond Mars, well beyond what the human
body can withstand in regard to radiation received during in-space trip time,
some form of serious radiation protection will be required"
48,"The in-space micro g, and probably even the"
49,"38g on Mars (or the 1/6th g on
the Moon), have serious physiological effects on the human body, including
wasting bones and muscles, eye problems, etc"
50,[ref
51,3]
52,"Rotational artificial gravity
incorporated into the design and the functionality of the deep space habs would
be efficacious"
53,"Having briefly described the space tourism issues for physical tourism, it is
interesting to contrast those with the increasing alternative, immersive
presence/digital reality [ref"
54,1]
55,"The development of digital reality (DR) or
virtual/non-physical presence began with the telegraph and progressed to the
telephone, then telephones with screens, and now to computers"
56,"The nearer
term developments of DR include augmented reality, advanced virtual reality (VR)
heading toward five senses VR, and holographic projection off of flat screens"
57,"Going forward with the availability of ever greater bandwidth and direct machine
to brain communications, instead of through the senses, DR is projected to be as
good as, or better than, physical reality"
58,"Even the current DR technology provides
the critical body language aspects of human communication"
59,"Compared to physical travel, DR provides the following benefits:
- Massive cost reductions, not just for transportation, total trip costs are
massively reduced (by factors of many millions)"
60,"- Large time savings, again, not just transportation time, huge savings in total
trip time
- Results in much improved use of time, can visit many planets/moons in a day
- Do not have to be absent from family
- Provides travel/entertainment experiences for all, affordably, on their
personal schedule, including the infirm and the young
- Enables expansion of the huge ongoing societal shift, begun some 25 years
ago with the Web, into the virtual age with tele-everything such as tele-
commuting, work, shopping, education, medicine, socialization, commerce,
politics, etc"
61,"- Healthier with regards to diet, sleep, exposure to space radiation, reduced
gravity, and other hazards of space
Even before COVID-19, a virtual leisure travel industry was developing
(including a wholly virtual “airline”)"
62,"This industry has greatly expanded during
COVID-19"
63,"The industry provides virtual tourism as an alternative to physical
tourism and along with the many benefits of DR already discussed, includes
virtual trips to destinations without the increasing crowding often prevalent for
physical travel and virtual trips, traveling adventures which are not physically
possible"
64,"This includes travel to historical places as they were in previous ages and
to inaccessible places in space"
65,"This virtual tourism industry has shown good
growth/success, especially during COVID"
66,Similar success has been observed with
67,"regard to virtual business conferences, with many more able to attend, no venue
costs/scheduling issues and excellent networking opportunities"
68,"Immersive presence space tourism to the Moon/Mars is a developing
business"
69,"What could be put together for children is a Martian experience where,
as they round a boulder a Martian of the parents’ choice in terms of configuration
is there to conduct a tour of their planet"
70,"The data to inform and enable building
these ever increasingly improving virtual experiences is provided by many
countries employing the many sensors, crawlers, etc"
71,"conducting scientific
exploration of planets, asteroids, moons and now, for the Earth’s Moon, industrial
development"
72,"This increasingly realistic alternative for space tourism is in the
context of digital reality and increasingly immersive with five senses haptics and
holographic projection under development"
73,"Current Status of Space Tourism
For physical space tourism there has been a near term emphasis upon
suborbital flights going forward"
74,"Orbital space tourism was begun by the Russians,
who in eight trips took seven tourists to the International Space Station (ISS) from
2001 to 2009 on Soyuz, after suitable training [ref"
75,4]
76,"The nominal cost of such
trips is now in the range of $20M to $25M, via Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic, Boeing
and Space X"
77,"There were several startups to provide orbital space tourism during
and after the Russian space tourist trips"
78,"These were not successful, perhaps
partially due to the economic conditions in that era"
79,The U
80,S
81,"is planning for Space
X Crew Dragon and Boeing Starliner to transport tourists (sometimes termed
spacecraft participants) to the ISS, with an ISS accommodation cost of $35K/day
each"
82,"NASA is largely responsible for the reinvigorated emphasis upon private
space travel"
83,"The NASA commercial crew program with Boeing and Space X has as
one of their objectives fostering commercial/private human space access"
84,"With
that program thus far a success, there are now serious plans to exploit that space
access capability for space tourism [ref"
85,5]
86,"Bigelow Aerospace and Orion Span
have nascent luxury orbital hotel designs"
87,"Space X and Space Adventures plan
Moon loop flights for $70 to $100 M"
88,"A survey indicates that there is significant
public interest in spending up to two weeks on the ISS with a spacewalk and some
are desirous of a space hotel"
89,"Space Adventures plans to fly two tourists to the ISS
in 2023 on Soyuz"
90,"Axion/Space X plan to fly three tourists to the ISS in 2021 for 10
days"
91,"Space Adventures and Space X plan a four to five day space trip, no ISS visit,"
92,in the 2021 time frame
93,"Axiom Space is planning a private module addition to ISS
as a hotel"
94,"There appears to be accelerating serious near term interest in orbital space
tourism"
95,"The current costs are, for most, daunting, but the activity, interest and
now emerging capabilities to do these trips plus the large Space X LEO access cost
reductions bode well for the future of space tourism, providing that there are no
accidents and loss of life"
96,"The projected mean number of missions for loss of crew
on space shuttle was a factor of order two less than what was actually observed"
97,"However, shuttle was designed in the 1970’s and built for half the projected cost
due to budget cuts"
98,We know more now and have more experience
99,"Therefore,
space tourism will probably experience at least the historical average on the order
of 100 flights between failures"
100,"The extent to which rocket safety can be
improved and its’ public acceptance is TBD"
101,"Serious space tourism is starting in
Earth orbit over the next few years"
102,"The two weeks or less in space, from the
available information, should not produce many of the adverse health effects that
characterize longer stays"
103,"ISS is within the planetary magnetic fields that offer
some protection from radiation (even though it’s above the protective
atmosphere)"
104,"In fact, the radiation exposure is half of that which would be
received in deep space (e"
105,g
106,"during trips to the Moon, Mars, and other
destinations)"
107,"Typical ISS duty periods for highly trained ISS astronauts is six
months"
108,A year on ISS for Astronaut Mark Kelly was difficult
109,"In deep space,
exposed to full radiation, serious radiation protection and probably artificial
gravity will be needed for such as Martian trips and beyond"
110,"With respect to the present status of virtual/digital space tourism, NASA
has a number of immersive/virtual tours of destinations such as the ISS and the
planets"
111,"Companies offer virtual tours of the Moon, Mars, the planets, and the
solar system"
112,"Google offers a tour of the ISS, space tours are on YouTube, and the
VR companies are planning to offer live virtual tours of Earth from space"
113,"Digital
reality will increasingly provide some 80% of the space tourism experience at
some million times less expense and some thousand times safer"
114,"The Outlook for Space Tourism
Due to costs of rocket production and operations including launch, those
technologies that provide extreme reductions in the costs of space access are the
fundamental enablers for space tourism [ref"
115,6]
116,"These costs are mainly due to
rocket manufacture and operations including those associated with launch"
117,The
118,bulk of the costs are human labor
119,"Space X has been extremely courageous and
successful in reducing these launch costs via reusable rockets, cutting
manufacture cost per launch, and in increasing automation, printing and
robotization for manufacture and operations, thereby cutting human labor costs"
120,"The cost of fuel is very minor (less than 1%) and constitutes the limit to which LEO
access costs can be reduced"
121,"Space X has produced a factor of six reduction in
space access costs and is well along in providing a factor of 14 reduction"
122,"Such
reductions are the basic enabler for affordable space travel"
123,"Increased use of
autonomy and robotics for manufacture of the other equipment required for
space tourism will also provide serious cost reductions with an overall resulting
trip cost that will be increasingly manageable by the public"
124,"Therefore, of the two
major issues/metrics for physical space tourism stated previously, cost and safety,
requisite cost reductions are on the horizon"
125,"Unfortunately, the many aspects and
issues surrounding safety are definitely works in progress"
126,"For physical space
tourism, short jaunts for the usual week(s) vacation period (e"
127,g
128,"to nearer
destinations such as space stations, the Moon, near Earth objects) would be
relatively safe with regard to the major health safety issues (E"
129,g
130,"micro g and
radiation)"
131,"However, launch safety and overall reliability probably still require
significant improvements for public tourism utilization"
132,"Longer trips to Mars and
beyond entail much longer trip times and probably artificial gravity and serious
radiation protection"
133,"Some have posited potential psychological issues would
occur for such long trips, which might be alleviated via holographic members of
the tourist group with characteristics updated periodically"

238,"Concluding Remarks
The bottom line on space tourism is that after some 60 years of highly
trained astronauts going into space, space related technologies and their costs
have altered to the point where increasing numbers of private citizens can
become space tourists"
239,"Initially, space travel would be suborbital for minimal
times and Earth orbital for up to two weeks, with nearer term plans by Space X to
do lunar flybys"
240,"There has also developed a now rapidly improving digital
reality/immersive virtual presence technology providing space tourism
experiences at minimal cost and available essentially to everyone"
241,"The safety
aspects of physical space tourism need further development, but those that relate
to the space environment are tolerable for a few weeks from the 60 years of
manned space flight experience"
242,"As space tourism expands beyond Earth orbit to
the Moon, Mars, asteroids, and other planets, the safety issues will need to be
seriously worked, and that is doable"
243,"The apparent breakthrough in the
resurgence of space tourism was the NASA commercial crew program, which was
partially targeted on space tourism and has led to the transportation necessary to
enable the nearer term, very few years out now, plans for a goodly expansion of
physical space tourism"
244,"This is only a portion of what will become major
opportunities and expansion of commercial space beyond Earth utilities/up to
GEO into deep space, initially the Moon, Mars, asteroids, and near Earth objects"
245,"All of this is greatly enhanced by the ongoing major reductions in the costs of
space access"
246,"Given the wonderous ongoing progress in AI-enhanced autonomous
robotics, for goodly cost and safety reasons, much to most of this commercial
deep space will probably not include onsite humans"
247,"There are projections that
travelers that colonize Mars will, over time, due to the reduced g and radiation
exposure, evolve into Martians"
