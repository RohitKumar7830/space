1,Space Tourism Dennis
2,Bushnell Introduction Since the late humans space defined herein Low Earth Orbit LEO and beyond have with very few exceptions been restricted highly trained astronauts
3,Going forward there increasing expectation that technologies will enable the public visit and vacation space
4,With the ever increasing capabilities what now termed digital reality immersive presence there are two approaches space vacations virtual and physical
5,Both will discussed herein ref
6,
7,The potential space tourism experiences include destinations such space stations moons planets and asteroids
8,Also virtually only with currently known projected technology planetsmoons around other stars
9,Discussed herein are the space tourism issues that technology needs addressis addressing enable space tourism resultant space tourism experiences and developing commercial deep space
10,Space dark cold nearly perfect vacuum with microgravity GEV galactic space radiation unimaginable distances where solid matter trace species but which supplies the energy that enables human existence
11,Space often times referred the final frontier and the general environmental conditions stated are very different than those under which humans have evolved Earth
12,Therefore considerable technology required enable humans space
13,fact even physics appears change cosmological scales including dark matterenergy huge disagreements between quantum theory and the cosmological constant and the mystery what happened the antimatter etc
14,There also the increasing interest and search for life other worlds which may silicon sulfurbased instead carbon
15,Overall there lot learn
16,Solar system destinations beyond the MoonMarsnearby asteroids require greatly increased trip time years decades costs distances and health and safety technologies
17,The Space Tourism Issues and Options The basic issues which must addressed enable space tourism are safetyreliability and costprice
18,these the first the most difficult and
19,includes many aspects including dust gravity radiation microother meteorites and reliability
20,There are very encouraging approaches reducing costsprice
21,Safety ref
22,Currently rockets malfunctiontoexplode the order every launches
23,That accident rate the order times the accident rate scheduled airlines
24,Sampling safety and reliability related issues aerospace Human error major source safety problems crashes even after many decades Research and Development and technologies reduce such Equipment failures due design installation operational employment maintenance aging environmental effects and tipping points for cascading system failures Electronphoton related failures including cybersoftware issues Electromagnetic Pulse EMPspace weatherradiation jamming failure equipment essential for navigation controls sensing propulsion and communications etc
25,Inadequate margins especially with regard cascading system systems failures where reduced capability does not fail the parent part but adversely impacts serious ways the functionalitiespiece parts that the overall system depends for robust performance
26,Operation extreme environmentsin the presence discrete extreme environmentaloperational conditions Bio becoming more virulent space
27,
28,pathogenesis corrosives Potential impacts reusability upon safety and reliability and certification for such Human health issues
29,
30,micro radiation psychological accidents illness etc
31,Costsprofitsschedule exigencies corner cutting Oxidative chemistry causing equipment failure Electrostatics causing electronic failures fires and explosions Planetary and moon dust abrasive corrosive oxidative Fatigue and fracture prime design metric for much aerospace equipage Unknown unknowns usually not possible anticipate all combinational situations conditions which will result reliability issue can become surprised reliabilitywise
32,Inadequate analysis and testing due usually either cost inadequate knowledge study aerospace general some the accidents are due human factors
33,Therefore the major first order approach safety would utilize autonomous Artificial Intelligence robotics both manufacture and operate rocketsspace access
34,Then there long list safety related designoperational precepts that can applied greatly improve rocket safety well the safety and reliability the spacecraft habitats onplanet transportation and the systems that keep humans healthy what externally terminally unhealthy space environment
35,The dust the Moon was found during Apollo problem and Mars with its rarefied atmosphere has huge long lasting dust storms
36,Therefore equipment must designed keep the inhabited areas dust free possible
37,Also spacecrafthabitats habs must designed protect against micrometeorites larger space debris ensure structural integrity and leak tight
38,Radiation space outside the protection Earths magnetic fields and dense atmosphere orders magnitude worse than that nuclear weapons
39,The most worrisome Galactic Cosmic Rays particle radiation such fully ionized iron tens GEV energy levels ref
40,
41,Protection from this requires four meters material either regolith living underground for inspace habs the same thickness materials with high hydrogen composition reduce the major health concerns with regard secondary neutron production
42,This radiation carcinogenic and effects nearly all physiological aspects including the cardiovascular and central nervous systems
43,alternative radiation protection approach fast transits
44,
45,day round trips Mars instead three years using the usual chemical rockets
46,There are least two approaches provide such fast transits
47,For destinations beyond Mars well beyond what the human body can withstand regard radiation received during inspace trip time some form serious radiation protection will required
48,The inspace micro and probably even the
49,Mars the the Moon have serious physiological effects the human body including wasting bones and muscles eye problems etc
50,ref
51,
52,Rotational artificial gravity incorporated into the design and the functionality the deep space habs would efficacious
53,Having briefly described the space tourism issues for physical tourism interesting contrast those with the increasing alternative immersive presencedigital reality ref
54,
55,The development digital reality virtualnonphysical presence began with the telegraph and progressed the telephone then telephones with screens and now computers
56,The nearer term developments include augmented reality advanced virtual reality heading toward five senses and holographic projection off flat screens
57,Going forward with the availability ever greater bandwidth and direct machine brain communications instead through the senses projected good better than physical reality
58,Even the current technology provides the critical body language aspects human communication
59,Compared physical travel provides the following benefits Massive cost reductions not just for transportation total trip costs are massively reduced factors many millions
60,Large time savings again not just transportation time huge savings total trip time Results much improved use time can visit many planetsmoons day not have absent from family Provides travelentertainment experiences for all affordably their personal schedule including the infirm and the young Enables expansion the huge ongoing societal shift begun some years ago with the Web into the virtual age with teleeverything such tele commuting work shopping education medicine socialization commerce politics etc
61,Healthier with regards diet sleep exposure space radiation reduced gravity and other hazards space Even before COVID virtual leisure travel industry was developing including wholly virtual airline
62,This industry has greatly expanded during COVID
63,The industry provides virtual tourism alternative physical tourism and along with the many benefits already discussed includes virtual trips destinations without the increasing crowding often prevalent for physical travel and virtual trips traveling adventures which are not physically possible
64,This includes travel historical places they were previous ages and inaccessible places space
65,This virtual tourism industry has shown good growthsuccess especially during COVID
66,Similar success has been observed with
67,regard virtual business conferences with many more able attend venue costsscheduling issues and excellent networking opportunities
68,Immersive presence space tourism the MoonMars developing business
69,What could put together for children Martian experience where they round boulder Martian the parents choice terms configuration there conduct tour their planet
70,The data inform and enable building these ever increasingly improving virtual experiences provided many countries employing the many sensors crawlers etc
71,conducting scientific exploration planets asteroids moons and now for the Earths Moon industrial development
72,This increasingly realistic alternative for space tourism the context digital reality and increasingly immersive with five senses haptics and holographic projection under development
73,Current Status Space Tourism For physical space tourism there has been near term emphasis upon suborbital flights going forward
74,Orbital space tourism was begun the Russians who eight trips took seven tourists the International Space Station ISS from Soyuz after suitable training ref
75,
76,The nominal cost such trips now the range via Blue Origin Virgin Galactic Boeing and Space
77,There were several startups provide orbital space tourism during and after the Russian space tourist trips
78,These were not successful perhaps partially due the economic conditions that era
79,The
80,
81,planning for Space Crew Dragon and Boeing Starliner transport tourists sometimes termed spacecraft participants the ISS with ISS accommodation cost Kday each
82,NASA largely responsible for the reinvigorated emphasis upon private space travel
83,The NASA commercial crew program with Boeing and Space has one their objectives fostering commercialprivate human space access
84,With that program thus far success there are now serious plans exploit that space access capability for space tourism ref
85,
86,Bigelow Aerospace and Orion Span have nascent luxury orbital hotel designs
87,Space and Space Adventures plan Moon loop flights for
88,survey indicates that there significant public interest spending two weeks the ISS with spacewalk and some are desirous space hotel
89,Space Adventures plans fly two tourists the ISS Soyuz
90,AxionSpace plan fly three tourists the ISS for days
91,Space Adventures and Space plan four five day space trip ISS visit
92,the time frame
93,Axiom Space planning private module addition ISS hotel
94,There appears accelerating serious near term interest orbital space tourism
95,The current costs are for most daunting but the activity interest and now emerging capabilities these trips plus the large Space LEO access cost reductions bode well for the future space tourism providing that there are accidents and loss life
96,The projected mean number missions for loss crew space shuttle was factor order two less than what was actually observed
97,However shuttle was designed the and built for half the projected cost due budget cuts
98,know more now and have more experience
99,Therefore space tourism will probably experience least the historical average the order flights between failures
100,The extent which rocket safety can improved and its public acceptance TBD
101,Serious space tourism starting Earth orbit over the next few years
102,The two weeks less space from the available information should not produce many the adverse health effects that characterize longer stays
103,ISS within the planetary magnetic fields that offer some protection from radiation even though its above the protective atmosphere
104,fact the radiation exposure half that which would received deep space
105,
106,during trips the Moon Mars and other destinations
107,Typical ISS duty periods for highly trained ISS astronauts six months
108,year ISS for Astronaut Mark Kelly was difficult
109,deep space exposed full radiation serious radiation protection and probably artificial gravity will needed for such Martian trips and beyond
110,With respect the present status virtualdigital space tourism NASA has number immersivevirtual tours destinations such the ISS and the planets
111,Companies offer virtual tours the Moon Mars the planets and the solar system
112,Google offers tour the ISS space tours are YouTube and the companies are planning offer live virtual tours Earth from space
113,Digital reality will increasingly provide some the space tourism experience some million times less expense and some thousand times safer
114,The Outlook for Space Tourism Due costs rocket production and operations including launch those technologies that provide extreme reductions the costs space access are the fundamental enablers for space tourism ref
115,
116,These costs are mainly due rocket manufacture and operations including those associated with launch
117,The
118,bulk the costs are human labor
119,Space has been extremely courageous and successful reducing these launch costs via reusable rockets cutting manufacture cost per launch and increasing automation printing and robotization for manufacture and operations thereby cutting human labor costs
120,The cost fuel very minor less than and constitutes the limit which LEO access costs can reduced
121,Space has produced factor six reduction space access costs and well along providing factor reduction
122,Such reductions are the basic enabler for affordable space travel
123,Increased use autonomy and robotics for manufacture the other equipment required for space tourism will also provide serious cost reductions with overall resulting trip cost that will increasingly manageable the public
124,Therefore the two major issuesmetrics for physical space tourism stated previously cost and safety requisite cost reductions are the horizon
125,Unfortunately the many aspects and issues surrounding safety are definitely works progress
126,For physical space tourism short jaunts for the usual weeks vacation period
127,
128,nearer destinations such space stations the Moon near Earth objects would relatively safe with regard the major health safety issues
129,
130,micro and radiation
131,However launch safety and overall reliability probably still require significant improvements for public tourism utilization
132,Longer trips Mars and beyond entail much longer trip times and probably artificial gravity and serious radiation protection
133,Some have posited potential psychological issues would occur for such long trips which might alleviated via holographic members the tourist group with characteristics updated periodically
134,Radiation Protection Options Decreasing Order Technology Readiness Level TRL For Moon planet etc
135,under three four meters regolith For space

238,Concluding Remarks The bottom line space tourism that after some years highly trained astronauts going into space space related technologies and their costs have altered the point where increasing numbers private citizens can become space tourists
239,Initially space travel would suborbital for minimal times and Earth orbital for two weeks with nearer term plans Space lunar flybys
240,There has also developed now rapidly improving digital realityimmersive virtual presence technology providing space tourism experiences minimal cost and available essentially everyone
241,The safety aspects physical space tourism need further development but those that relate the space environment are tolerable for few weeks from the years manned space flight experience
242,space tourism expands beyond Earth orbit the Moon Mars asteroids and other planets the safety issues will need seriously worked and that doable
243,The apparent breakthrough the resurgence space tourism was the NASA commercial crew program which was partially targeted space tourism and has led the transportation necessary enable the nearer term very few years out now plans for goodly expansion physical space tourism
244,This only portion what will become major opportunities and expansion commercial space beyond Earth utilitiesup GEO into deep space initially the Moon Mars asteroids and near Earth objects
245,All this greatly enhanced the ongoing major reductions the costs space access
246,Given the wonderous ongoing progress AIenhanced autonomous robotics for goodly cost and safety reasons much most this commercial deep space will probably not include onsite humans
247,There are projections that travelers that colonize Mars will over time due the reduced and radiation exposure evolve into Martians
